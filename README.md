Hello Triangle Vulkan demo -- vertex binding offset
=========================

This is a traditional Hello World style application for the Vulkan API. It
renders a RGB shaded equilateral triangle (well, if the resolution is a square).
And it tries if vertex binding offset using `vkCmdBindVertexBuffers()` works.

The code is relatively flat and basic, so I think it's good enough for learning.
No tutorial or even much comments are provided though (comments do lie anyway
:smirk:). Though some things I found noteworthy are in the `doc/` folder.

My goal here is to be perfectly conformant to the Vulkan specification. Also I
do handle all the Vulkan `VkResult`s (with app termination though). And I try to
do things in the efficient way, rather than simplify. But I am only human.
:innocent:

Branches
-----------------

The git branches demonstrate some basic Vulkan features which can be easily
grafted on this basic example (it is nice to see a diff of what exactly needs to
be changed to make it work). Their `README.md` should be edited to reflect the
changes.

Requirements
----------------------------

**OS**: Windows or Linux  
**Language**: C++14  
**Build environment**: (latest) [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) (requires `VULKAN_SDK` variable being set)  
**Build environment[Windows]**: Visual Studio, Cygwin, or MinGW (or IDEs running on top of them)  
**Build environment[Linux]**: CMake compatible compiler and build system and `libxcb-dev` and `libxcb-keysyms-dev`  
**Build environment[MacOS]**: CMake compatible compiler and build system  
**Build Environment[GLFW]**: GLFW 3.2+ (already included as a git submodule), requires `xorg-dev` (or XCB) package on Linux  
**Build environment[Xlib]**: Requires `xorg-dev` package  
**Build environment[XCB]**: Requires `libxcb1-dev`, `libxcb-util-dev`, `libxcb-keysyms1-dev`, and `x11proto-dev` packages  
**Build environment[Wayland]**: Requires `libwayland-dev` and `libxkbcommon-dev` packages  
**Target Environment**: installed (latest) Vulkan capable drivers (to see anything)  
**Target Environment**: GLFW(recommended), XCB, Xlib, or Wayland based windowing system

On Unix-like environment refer to
[SDK docs](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/linux/getting_started.html)
on how to set `VULKAN_SDK` variable.

Adding `VkSurface` support for other platforms should be straightforward using
the provided ones as a template for it.

Config
---------------------------------------

You can change the application configuration by simply changing following
variables in `HelloTriangle.cpp`.

| config variable | purpose | default |
|---|---|---|
| `appName` | Application name; might show up in title of the window | whatever it is in code |
| `debugSeverity` | Which kinds of debug message severites will be shown | `WARNING` \| `ERROR` |
| `debugType` | Which kinds of debug message types will be shown | all types |
| `useAssistantLayer` | Enable Assistant Layer too when debugging (TODO: does not support new way of enabling) | `false` |
| `fpsCounter` | Enable FPS counter via `VK_LAYER_LUNARG_monitor` layer | `true` |
| `initialWindowWidth` | The initial width of the rendered window | `800` |
| `initialWindowHeight` | The initial height of the rendered window | `800` |
| `presentMode` | The presentation mode of Vulkan used in swapchain | `VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR` <sup>1</sup>|
| `clearColor` | Background color of the rendering | gray (`{0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f, 1.0f}`) |
| `forceSeparatePresentQueue` | By default the app prioritizes single Graphics and Present queue. This will create separate queues for testing purposes. There are virtually no platforms currently that naturally have separate Present queue family. |

<sup>1</sup> I preferred `VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR` before but it tends to
make coil whine because of the extreme FPS (which could be unnecessarily
dangerous to the PCB in the long term).

Build
----------------------------------------------

First just get everything:

    $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/krOoze/Hello_Triangle.git

In many platforms CMake style build should work just fine:

    $ cmake -G"Your preferred generator"

or even just

    $ cmake .

Then use `make`, or the generated Visual Studio `*.sln`, or whatever it created.

There are two cmake options (supplied by `-D`):
 - `WSI` -- set this to `USE_PLATFORM_GLFW` or any `VK_USE_PLATFORM_*_KHR` to
    select the WSI to be used. Default is GLFW.
 - `TODO` -- set this to `OFF` to remove TODO messages during compilation.

You also might want to add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`.

Manual Build
----------------------------------------------

The code base is quite simple and it can be built manually. It only assumes that
the `src` folder is in the include path, that you link the GLFW dependency, and
that you compile the GLSL shader files into SPIR-V.

In Visual Studio you can simply import the code and add the things mentioned
above. Either "console" or "window" subsystem is a valid choice on Windows.

In Linux distro you would do e.g.:

    $ g++ --std=c++14 -Wall -m64 -D_DEBUG -DNO_TODO -I$VULKAN_SDK/include -I./src/ -o./HelloTriangle src/HelloTriangle.cpp -ldl -L$VULKAN_SDK/lib -lvulkan -lglfw

GLSL shaders can be compiled using `glslc` from LunarG Vulkan SDK like so:  
On Windows-like environment:

    %VULKAN_SDK%/Bin/glslc -mfmt=c -o ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.vert.spv.inl ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.vert
    %VULKAN_SDK%/Bin/glslc -mfmt=c -o ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.frag.spv.inl ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.frag

Or on Unix-like environment you would use just `$VULKAN_SDK` instead:

    $VULKAN_SDK/Bin/glslc -mfmt=c -o ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.vert.spv.inl ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.vert
    $VULKAN_SDK/Bin/glslc -mfmt=c -o ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.frag.spv.inl ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.frag

There are annoying (on purpose) TODOs generated on build. They can be disabled
by defining `NO_TODO` preprocessor macro.

Using GLFW is optional. You may choose another windowing platform by modifying
`VulkanEnvironment.h`, or supplying it via preprocessor. By default, all
platforms use GLFW.

Run
------------------------

You just run it as you would anything else.

<kbd>Esc</kbd> does terminate the app.  
<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> toggles fullscreen (might not work on some WSI
platforms).
